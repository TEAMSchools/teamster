# CLAUDE.md — `.devcontainer/`

Container configuration for Codespace and local development.

## Setup Lifecycle

- **`postCreate.sh`** runs once on container creation — installs dependencies,
  sets up GCP auth, removes `sudo`
- **`postStart.sh`** runs on every container start — refreshes GCP ADC, Claude
  auth, VS Code tasks. Keep it idempotent.
- **Post-build VS Code task**: "Setup: Post-Build Init" runs automatically on
  folder open after a rebuild — handles GCloud ADC, Claude auth, plugin
  installation, and dbt dev dataset checks. Individual tasks available via
  `Ctrl+Shift+P` → `Tasks: Run Task`. The task polls with `pgrep` until
  `postCreate.sh`/`postStart.sh` finish — VS Code fires `folderOpen` before they
  complete, so this guard is intentional; do not remove it.

## Secret Injection

**`inject-secrets.sh`**: manually run to inject 1Password secrets into the
environment. Required for Dagster development; not needed for SQL-only work. Run
after container start if env vars or secrets are missing.

- **Adding a new secret**: update **both** the symlink validation loop and the
  injection `for` loop — omitting either silently skips the secret.

## Quirks

- **`apt-get update` permission errors in `postCreate.sh`**: stale root-owned
  files in `/var/lib/apt/lists/partial/` from the image build cause permission
  denied errors; pre-clean with
  `sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/partial /var/cache/apt/archives/partial`
  before running `apt-get update`
- **`sudo` removed**: at the end of `postCreate.sh` — privileged setup (gcloud
  components, Helm) must go in `postCreate.sh`, not later. To add new
  components, update `postCreate.sh` and rebuild the container.
- **`--cap-add` stripped**: Codespaces silently strips `--cap-add` from
  `runArgs` — namespace-based sandboxing (bwrap, unshare) will not work. Hooks
  are the sole enforcement layer for path-based access control.
- **Protected scripts**: `.devcontainer/scripts/` is read-only under hooks —
  present changes as manual application blocks, not diffs. `.vscode/scripts/` is
  **not** hook-protected and can be edited directly.
- **Machine-scoped VS Code settings**: devcontainer features auto-seed
  `/home/vscode/.vscode-remote/data/Machine/settings.json` (e.g., wrong
  `python.defaultInterpreterPath`, `ms-python.autopep8` as Python formatter).
  Workspace settings override these at runtime, but warnings appear during
  `postCreate` before the workspace loads. Patch this file early in
  `postCreate.sh` via `jq` to suppress them.

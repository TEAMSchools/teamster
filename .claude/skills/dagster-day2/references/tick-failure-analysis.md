# Tick failure analysis

Apply when a location shows >5 gRPC UNAVAILABLE tick failures in the window. Two
dominant causes — Service recreation vs pod preemption — need to be
disambiguated before attributing root cause, because they imply different fixes.

## Procedure

1. Sort failure ticks ascending, cluster by gap >120s.
2. Count distinct gRPC IPs across the failure ticks. **Multiple distinct
   ClusterIPs = agent-driven Service recreation.** The `dagster-cloud` agent's
   `unique_resource_name()`
   (`dagster_cloud/workspace/user_code_launcher/utils.py`) uses a fresh
   `uuid4().hex[:6]` suffix on every reconcile, so every Deployment+Service
   recreate gets a new ClusterIP. Services are never updated in place — always
   delete-old / create-new. This IS a major source of tick gaps independent of
   preemption. Check the audit log
   (`protoPayload.methodName="io.k8s.core.v1.services.create"` on the
   `dagster-cloud` namespace) to confirm and count recreations.
3. Cross-reference deploy timestamps from location load history (step 3 data)
   AND control-plane-driven reconciliations (any `update_timestamp` change
   triggers Service recreate — code pushes, workspace refreshes, UI
   interactions). Clusters aligned with a deploy/reconcile = Service recreation
   (1–3 ticks per recreate, bounded by code server startup p95 ~22s).
4. For remaining clusters: query GKE pod events for `<location>-prod-*` pods in
   the failure window (`mcp__gke__query_logs`, reason includes Preempted,
   Evicted, OOMKilling, Killing).
5. Classify by GKE event type:
   - **Preempted** "by pod `<uuid>`": priority preemption by run/step pods. In
     this codebase, code server pods run at priority 0 and run/step pods run at
     priority 1000 (`dagster-run` PriorityClass in
     `.k8s/dagster/values-override.yaml`) BY DESIGN — preempting code servers to
     free capacity for runs is intentional. Routine preemption is expected, not
     an escalation. Only escalate if: (a) preemption rate is
     sustained >>1/location/hour, (b) no correlation with run/step pod
     scheduling, or (c) code server pods are being preempted while run/step pods
     are idle. Check for hourly pattern (>50% in first 5 min of hour =
     schedule-triggered bursts). PDB is bypassed for priority preemption.
   - **Evicted** "low on resource: memory": node memory pressure. Monitor.
   - **OOMKilling**: container OOM (pod survives, container restarts).
     Investigate memory requests.
   - **Killing** without Preempted/Evicted: agent cleanup or deploy rollover.

If no GKE pod events correlate with tick failures AND only a single gRPC IP
appears, consider health check starvation — long sensor evals blocking gRPC
threads. Diagnose: agent logs "failed a health check … 300 seconds" +
SuccessfulCreate frequency.

## Rule of thumb

Count Service recreations vs pod preemptions in the window. If recreations >>
preemptions, Service churn is the dominant cause and no amount of preemption
mitigation (anti-affinity, priority tuning) will help — the fix is agent-side
(reducing reconciliation rate or upstream deterministic naming).

# Cube Access Model — Reviewer Guide

Refold-c security redesign · June 2026

## What this is

This document explains how the new Cube access model works and what the values
in `dim_staff_cube_access` mean. It is intended for anyone spot-checking the
access assignments spreadsheet or reviewing the PR before merge.

## How access is resolved

When a staff member queries Cube, the system looks up their Google Workspace
email in `kipptaf_marts.dim_staff_cube_access`. That table has one row per
active, primary-position staff member. Their row determines:

1. **Which views they can see** (column visibility — "tiers")
2. **Which rows they can see** within those views (row-level filters)

If a staff member's email is not found — e.g. a non-staff admin account — they
see nothing. Default deny.

Results are cached until midnight ET each night, so access changes take effect
the next day.

Mechanically, access is enforced entirely by each Cube view's own
`access_policy:` block — there is no separate server-side row-filtering step.
Identity resolution (the `dim_staff_cube_access` + `dim_staff_reporting_chain`
reads) happens once per request in the auth hooks and is shaped into a set of
groups; each view's `access_policy` grants column/row access to whichever group
the viewer holds.

## The two axes of access

### Column visibility (tiers)

Cube views use `access_policy` blocks to gate which fields are visible. A staff
member either has a tier or they do not — there is no partial visibility within
a tier.

| Tier                 | What it unlocks                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `staff-directory`    | Every staff member gets this automatically. Name, email, title, location, work contact info.                                                   |
| `staff-pii`          | Personal email, personal cell, date of birth, gender identity, race/ethnicity.                                                                 |
| `staff-compensation` | Compensation fields (no cube/view built yet — reserved).                                                                                       |
| `staff-observations` | Observation scores and feedback (no cube/view built yet — reserved).                                                                           |
| `staff-benefits`     | Benefits enrollment data (no cube/view built yet — reserved).                                                                                  |
| `student`            | All student data — every student view (summary + detail), all fields incl. names, contact info, and other direct identifiers. Location-scoped. |

Internally, `staff-pii` and `student` each fan out to one scope-specific group
per enum value below (e.g. `staff-pii-teaching_staff`, `student-region`), with
the matching `access_policy` block living on `staff_pii.yml` (split out of the
old `staff_detail.yml`) or the relevant student view. The table above describes
the resulting access, which is unchanged; group names are an implementation
detail — see [`src/cube/CLAUDE.md`](../../../src/cube/CLAUDE.md) if you need
them.

### Row-level scope (who they can see within a view)

Tiers open up columns. Scope enums determine which _rows_ are returned once a
column is visible.

For **student views**, the scope is a location level — it restricts which
schools' students appear.

For **staff sensitive fields** (PII, compensation, observations, benefits), the
scope is a remit — which staff members the viewer can see sensitive data about.
Two axes intersect: location and department. Both must pass, and the most
restrictive field in a query wins.

## Scope enum glossary

### Location scope (student and staff)

Used by: `student_location_scope`, `staff_location_scope`

| Value     | What rows are returned                     |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `network` | All locations across all regions.          |
| `region`  | Only locations in the viewer's own region. |
| `school`  | Only the viewer's own school.              |
| `none`    | No rows. The tier is not granted.          |

### Department scope (staff only)

Used by: `staff_department_scope`

This works in _combination_ with `staff_location_scope` — both must allow a row
for it to appear.

| Value       | What rows are returned                                                                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `all`       | All departments within the location scope.                                                 |
| `own_group` | Only staff in the viewer's own `department_group` (e.g. `talent`, `finance`, `academics`). |
| `none`      | No rows. Treated as deny.                                                                  |

### Sensitive field scope (per-field)

Used by: `staff_pii_scope`, `staff_compensation_scope`,
`staff_observations_scope`, `staff_benefits_scope`

These enums set the row filter applied _when that specific sensitive field is in
the query_. If a query includes multiple sensitive fields, the system applies
all their filters — the intersection is what the viewer sees.

| Value                           | Who the viewer can see sensitive data about                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `all_in_scope`                  | Anyone within their shared staff remit (location scope ∩ department scope).                                                                                    |
| `teaching_staff`                | Only teachers and teachers-in-residence (`TEACH`, `TIR` job function codes) within their remit.                                                                |
| `reporting_chain`               | Only their direct and indirect reports (transitive org tree from `dim_staff_reporting_chain`).                                                                 |
| `reporting_chain_or_below_rank` | Their reporting chain _plus_ anyone in their remit with a higher `job_function_level` number (i.e. more junior). Level 6 = most junior; level 1 = most senior. |
| `none`                          | No access to this sensitive field.                                                                                                                             |

There is no separate student PII scope. A non-`none` `student_location_scope`
grants one scope-specific `student-*` group (`student-region` / `student-school`
/ `student-network`), which sees all student fields (including PII) subject only
to that group's location row filter.

## Department groups (reference)

The `department_group` column is a coarsened grouping used for `own_group`
department scope checks.

| Value               | Departments it covers                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `academics`         | Teaching and Learning, Teacher Development         |
| `talent`            | Human Resources, Talent Acquisition                |
| `finance`           | Finance, Accounting, Purchasing                    |
| `school_operations` | Operations, Real Estate and Facilities, Technology |
| `advancement`       | Development, Marketing/Comms/Enrollment            |
| `student_services`  | Special Education, counselors                      |
| `data_technology`   | Data, Technology                                   |
| `kipp_forward`      | KIPP Forward                                       |
| `executive`         | Executive/C-suite                                  |
| `school_leadership` | Principals, APs, KTRGs at the school level         |

## Job function levels (reference)

Higher number = more junior. Used by `reporting_chain_or_below_rank` to
determine who a viewer can see sensitive data about.

| Level  | Typical titles                                      |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | Chief officers, Co-Presidents, Executive Directors  |
| 2      | Managing Directors, EDs/HoS                         |
| 3      | Senior Directors                                    |
| 4      | Directors                                           |
| 5      | Managers, Associates, Specialists (KTRGS)           |
| 6      | Teachers, TIRs, non-instructional staff, counselors |
| `null` | Interns, unmatched roles → no access                |

## Things to flag when spot-checking

- **All `none` scopes**: expected for interns and roles not in the access
  spreadsheet. If a non-intern has all-none, their `job_function_code` may be
  missing from the role sheet.
- **`staff_pii_scope` = `all_in_scope` for HR/Talent**: intentional — HR staff
  need to see PII for their department's staff. Confirm the department override
  row in the spreadsheet covers the right departments.
- **`student_location_scope` = `none` for a regional ops leader**: may be
  intentional (ops directors don't need student data) — check against their
  role.
- **`null` `job_function_level`**: the role exists but has no level assigned in
  the role sheet. Access will still be granted from the other scope columns, but
  `reporting_chain_or_below_rank` will not work correctly for that person as a
  manager.

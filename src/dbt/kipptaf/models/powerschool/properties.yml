      This view is a complete enrollment history of all students with enrollments in PowerSchool.
      The exception to this are students with the same entry and exit dates in PowerSchool ("no-show" students who never attended a KTAF school) and students with an "inactive" enrollment status in PowerSchool (primarily used for duplicate records).
      It also includes all key demographic data for students and student identifiers.
      Current enrollment records come from `stg_powerschool__students` and previous enrollments come from `stg_powerschool__reenrollments`.

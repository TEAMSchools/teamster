# CLAUDE.md — `src/dbt/`

## Overview

Fifteen dbt projects organized into three tiers:

| Tier                  | Projects                                                                                                           | Purpose                                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Source-system**     | `amplify`, `deanslist`, `edplan`, `finalsite`, `iready`, `overgrad`, `pearson`, `powerschool`, `renlearn`, `titan` | Clean and contract-enforce raw data from one source system    |
| **District-specific** | `kippnewark`, `kippcamden`, `kippmiami`, `kipppaterson`                                                            | Combine source packages for a single district                 |
| **Network analytics** | `kipptaf`                                                                                                          | Cross-district marts, reporting, and extracts for the network |

Data flows **source → district → kipptaf**: source-system projects are consumed
as local dbt packages by district projects, which are in turn sourced by
`kipptaf`.

Not every district uses every source package. See each district project's
CLAUDE.md for its active packages.

## District Variable Defaults

All district projects share these variables (override via `dbt_project.yml`):

- `current_academic_year`, `current_fiscal_year` — updated each July; get
  current values from any district's `dbt_project.yml`
- `local_timezone` — `America/New_York`
- `cloud_storage_uri_base` — `gs://teamster-<project>/dagster/<project>`
- `powerschool_external_location_root` —
  `gs://teamster-<project>/dagster/<project>/powerschool` (ODBC districts only)

Exceptions: `kippnewark` adds `iready_schema: kippnj_iready` and
`renlearn_schema: kippnj_renlearn`. `kipptaf` has
`bigquery_external_connection_name` — see its CLAUDE.md.

## Variable Override Pattern

Source-system projects declare variables with null/zero defaults
(`bigquery_external_connection_name: null`, `current_academic_year: 0`, etc.).
Consuming district projects override these in their own `dbt_project.yml`. This
allows the same source project code to work across multiple district
deployments.

## External Table Pattern

All staging sources use BigQuery external tables backed by GCS (Avro format,
BigLake connection, 7-day staleness window). Each source's `sources.yml`
includes `dagster: asset_key` metadata so Dagster can track lineage.

## CI External Table Setup

New external tables must be staged in the `z_dev_` schema before kipptaf CI can
reference them via `union_relations`. Use `--target staging` with both
`dbt-sxs.py` and `dbt build`. The default `--target dev` creates tables in your
personal `zz_<user>_*` schema, which CI does not see.

`dbt-sxs.py` flags are independent: `--test` controls the GCS bucket
(`teamster-test` vs production), `--target` controls the BigQuery schema.

## Model Conventions

These conventions apply to **every** dbt project in this directory. Per-project
CLAUDE.md files reference this section rather than repeating it.

### Per-layer requirements

**All staging models must**:

1. Have `contract: enforced: true` (set at directory level in `dbt_project.yml`)
2. Have a uniqueness test — either `unique:` on a single column or
   `dbt_utils.unique_combination_of_columns`

**All intermediate models must**:

1. Have a uniqueness test
2. Not be consumed directly by external tools or reports — a reporting view
   (`rpt_*`) must always sit between an intermediate model and an external
   consumer, buffering external dependencies from internal schema evolution

**All `rpt_`, `dim_*`, and `fct_*` models must**:

1. Have `contract: enforced: true`
2. Have a uniqueness test

### Uniqueness test examples

```yaml
# single-column uniqueness
columns:
  - name: surrogate_key
    data_tests:
      - unique

# multi-column uniqueness (when no single column is unique)
data_tests:
  - dbt_utils.unique_combination_of_columns:
      arguments:
        combination_of_columns:
          - column_a
          - column_b
```

### Test config defaults

- Do not add `store_failures: true` to individual tests — the project default
  handles it
- Tests that must error (not warn) need explicit `config: severity: error`
- Unscoped `+config` applies to tests from all installed packages, not just the
  current project

### SQL conventions

- **Soft-delete filters**: Apply in the **staging model**, not in downstream
  `ON` clauses. Deleted rows should never reach intermediate or mart models.
  Omit columns whose value is predetermined by the WHERE filter (e.g.,
  `deleted_at` after `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`) — they add no signal.
- **No `GROUP BY` without aggregation** — use `DISTINCT` instead (see next rule
  for deduplication constraints).
- **No manual deduplication** — do not use `SELECT DISTINCT` or
  `qualify row_number() over (...) = 1` for deduplication. Use
  `dbt_utils.deduplicate()` with an explicit `partition_by` and `order_by`. If
  `DISTINCT` is truly unavoidable, it must include a `-- TODO:` comment
  explaining why and what needs to be fixed upstream.
- **No `GROUP BY ALL`** — list grouping columns explicitly. `GROUP BY ALL`
  breaks silently when upstream columns change.
- **No `ORDER BY`** — ordering belongs in the reporting layer, not dbt models.
- **No `SELECT *` in final `SELECT` of `rpt_`/mart models** — list columns
  explicitly. Pass-through CTEs (`select * from ref(...)`) are fine. Get the
  authoritative column list via `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`:

  ```sql
  select column_name
  from `teamster-332318`.<schema>.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
  where table_name = '<model_name>'
  order by ordinal_position
  ```

- **`ON` vs `WHERE`** — row filters on the preserved table belong in `WHERE`,
  not `ON`. For `LEFT JOIN`, a filter in `ON` preserves non-matching rows.
  Exception: `FULL JOIN` conditions referencing one side stay in `ON`.
- **Timezone-aware today**:

  ```sql
  current_date('{{ var("local_timezone") }}')
  ```

### SQL column ordering in SELECT clauses (enforced by ST06)

Columns within a SELECT **must** follow this order — no interleaving:

1. Column enumerations (plain refs), grouped by source table in join order,
   separated by a blank line between each table's group
2. Constants and literals
3. Simple functions (`coalesce(...)`, simple `if(...)`)
4. Nested functions
5. Logicals (`if(condition, true, false)`)
6. Case statements
7. Window functions (`row_number() over (...)`)

When a SELECT reads from a single table/CTE, do not prefix columns with the
alias.

### YAML conventions

- All new or modified models require `description:` on the model and every
  column. Profile staging data via BigQuery MCP; infer downstream from parents.
  Describe calculated fields by logic. Use qualitative language — no stats.
- Columns with `data_tests:` should be sorted to the top of the `columns:` list
  for visibility.
- Column renames for semantic clarity (e.g., boolean prefixing with `is_`,
  reserved word aliases) belong in the staging model, not downstream.

### Legacy `base_` prefix

Existing `base_` models are being renamed to `int_`
([#2541](https://github.com/TEAMSchools/teamster/issues/2541)). Do not create
new `base_` models.

## SQL Style

All SQL follows `.trunk/config/.sqlfluff`. Key enforced rules:

- **Dialect**: BigQuery
- **Trailing commas**: required in `SELECT` clauses
- **Reserved words**: BigQuery reserved words as column names must be
  backtick-quoted in SQL and have `quote: true` in properties YAML
- **String literals**: single quotes only (no double quotes)
- **Line length**: 88 characters max

Do not flag code that follows these rules.

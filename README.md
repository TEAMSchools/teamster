## Installation

Choose a way to install the MCP Server and then connect your AI to it.

### Use as a Gemini CLI Extension

1. Install
   [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#-installation).

2. Install the extension

```sh
gemini extensions install https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gke-mcp.git
```

### Use in MCP Clients / Other AIs

#### Quick Install (Linux & macOS only)

```sh
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gke-mcp/main/install.sh | bash
```

#### Manual Install

If you haven't already installed Go, follow
[these instructions](https://go.dev/doc/install).

Once Go is installed, run the following command to install gke-mcp:

```sh
go install github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gke-mcp@latest
```

The `gke-mcp` binary will be installed in the directory specified by the `GOBIN`
environment variable. If `GOBIN` is not set, it defaults to `$GOPATH/bin` and,
if `GOPATH` is also not set, it falls back to `$HOME/go/bin`.

You can find the exact location by running `go env GOBIN`. If the command
returns an empty value, run `go env GOPATH` to find the installation directory.

For additional help, refer to the troubleshoot section:
[gke-mcp: command not found](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#gke-mcp-command-not-found-on-macos-or-linux).

### Add the MCP Server to your AI

For detailed instructions on how to connect the GKE MCP Server to various AI
clients, including cursor, Visual Studio Code, and claude desktop, please refer
to our dedicated [installation guide](docs/installation_guide/).

## MCP Tools

- `cluster_toolkit`: Creates AI optimized GKE Clusters.
- `list_clusters`: List your GKE clusters.
- `get_cluster`: Get detailed about a single GKE Cluster.
- `create_cluster`: Create a new GKE Cluster.
- `get_kubeconfig`: Config the kubeconfig to a single GKE Cluster.
- `giq_generate_manifest`: Generate a GKE manifest for AI/ML inference workloads
  using Google Inference Quickstart.
- `list_recommendations`: List recommendations for your GKE clusters.
- `query_logs`: Query Google Cloud Platform logs using Logging Query Language
  (LQL).
- `get_log_schema`: Get the schema for a specific GKE log type.

## MCP Commands

Commands provide in-context domain specific functionality based on expert
knowledge and best practices.

- `gke-upgrade-risk-report`: GKE control plane upgrade risk report, analyzing
  the potential risks of upgrading from its current version to the target
  version. Performs pre-upgrade checks, API deprecations scans, and more.
- `gke-upgrades-best-practices-risk-report`: GKE control plane upgrade best
  practices, applied for the specified cluster. Helps making upgrades
  uneventful.

## MCP Context

In addition to the tools above, a lot of value is provided through the bundled
context instructions.

- **Cost**: The provided instructions allows the AI to answer many questions
  related to GKE costs, including queries related to clusters, namespaces, and
  Kubernetes workloads.

- **GKE Known Issues**: The provided instructions allows the AI to fetch the
  latest GKE Known issues and check whether the cluster is affected by one of
  these known issues.

## Supported MCP Transports

By default, `gke-mcp` uses the
[stdio]("https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports#stdio")
transport. Additionally, the
[Streamable HTTP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports#streamable-http)
transport is supported as well.

You can set the transport mode using the following options:

`--server-mode`: transport to use for the server: stdio (default) or http

`--server-port`: server port to use when server-mode is http or sse; defaults to
8080

```sh
gke-mcp --server-mode http --server-port 8080
```

> [!WARNING] When using the `Streamable HTTP` transport, the server listens on
> all network interfaces (e.g., `0.0.0.0`), which can expose it to any network
> your machine is connected to. Please ensure you have a firewall ad/or other
> security measures in place to restrict access if the server is not intended to
> be public.

### Connecting Gemini CLI to the HTTP Server

To connect Gemini CLI to the `gke-mcp` HTTP server, you need to configure the
CLI to point to the correct endpoint. You can do this by updating your
`~/.gemini/settings.json` file. For a basic setup without authentication, the
file should look like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gke": {
      "httpUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:8080/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration tells Gemini CLI how to reach the gke-mcp server running on
your local machine at port 8080.

## Development

To compile the binary and update the `gemini-cli` extension with your local
changes, follow these steps:

1. Remove the global gke-mcp configuration

   ```sh
   rm -rf ~/.gemini/extensions/gke-mcp
   ```

1. Build the binary from the root of the project:

   ```sh
   go build -o gke-mcp .
   ```

1. Run the installation command to update the extension manifest:

   ```sh
   ./gke-mcp install gemini-cli --developer
   ```

   This will make `gemini-cli` use your locally compiled binary.

# CLAUDE.md — `.k8s/`

Helm overrides and deploy scripts for Dagster Cloud agent and 1Password Connect
on GKE Autopilot.

## Conventions

- `values.yaml` is auto-downloaded from Helm — never edit. All customizations go
  in `values-override.yaml`.
- `safe-to-evict: "false"` only blocks cluster autoscaler evictions — kubelet
  node-pressure evictions (exit 137, OOM) are unaffected. Scale-Out density
  makes these occasional; Dagster retries automatically.
